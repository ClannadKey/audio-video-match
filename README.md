# audio-video-match

Matching 120x128(audio feature, output of the VGG) and 120x1024(video feature, output of the Inception）.

We got 96.7% top5 accuracy in the test samples when 30 A(audio) match 30 V(video).

The files SSSV2AandA2V.py, ResFunction.py and _simi_matrix.py were written by me.

The code of neural network is in the file ResFunction.py.

The structure is in 实验报告.docx(project report).

All the codes and 实验报告.docx(project report) are in the file VA_match.
