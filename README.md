# audio-video-match

Matching 120x128(audio feature, output of the VGG) and 120x128(video feature, output of the inception）.

We got 96.7% top5 accuracy in the test samples when 30 A(audio) match 30 V(video).

The files SSSV2AandA2V.py, ResFunction.py and _simi_matrix.py were written by me.

The structure is in 实验报告.docx(project report).

All the codes and 实验报告.docx(project report) are in the file VA_match.
